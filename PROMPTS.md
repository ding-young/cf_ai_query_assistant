# Note
The frontend was primarily written using a coding assistant, while for the backend, it was used only for debugging or asking questions. The following are the prompts that were used.
# Frontend
Create a web application interface with the title (h1) "AI SQL Generator & Runner" at the top of the page.
The overall layout should be a single, vertical column, with each functional section clearly separated using shadcn/ui's Card component.

- "Data Request" Card:
Add a title (h3) at the top of the card: "Data Request:".
Below it, place a Textarea component that allows multi-line input.
Set the Textarea's placeholder text to "Show me the 5 most recent orders".
In the card footer, add a blue Button (primary variant) with the text "Generate SQL".

- "Generated SQL" Card:
Add a title (h3) at the top of the card: "Generated SQL (ID: 3)". The "(ID: 3)" part is a placeholder for dynamic text.
Below it, place a Textarea component to display the generated SQL query. This text area should be read-only or disabled.
Inside the Textarea, display an example SQL query (e.g., SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 5;) using a monospace font.
In the card footer, add a blue Button (primary variant) with the text "Run SQL".

- "Execution Result" Area:
This area should be conditionally displayed below the "Generated SQL" card.
To match the failure state, create a red Alert (destructive variant). The AlertTitle should be "SQL Failure", and the AlertDescription should be "Load failed".
- "Recent History" Card:
In the CardHeader, add a title (h3): "Recent History".
Right next to the title (h3) (on the right side), place a Button (variant="ghost", size="icon") with a refresh icon.
In the CardContent, create a list showing recent activities.
Each list item should consist of:
A Badge indicating the execution status (e.g., "[Not Executed]", "[Executed]").
The natural language request text entered by the user (e.g., "Find the total revenue for each product category").
A dark-background Code block (or \<pre>\<code> tag style) showing the SQL query generated from that request.

The overall style should be modern and clean, using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, with ample margin (space-y) between each card.

# Backend
- If I want to separate the backend (using the 'hello-world' workers-rs template) and the frontend, what should the repo structure be? The repo is named cf_ai_query_assistant.

- Do I still have to handle Cloudflare Workers CORS manually when using workers-rs?

- The workers-rs repo mentions http features and the Router. Can you explain those to me again in more detail?

- Is there an alternative to console_error_panic_hook? Something to make debugging server failures easier.

- Here's an error I encountered. AI Error: Error: AiError: 5006: Error: oneOf at '/' not met, 0 matches: required properties at '/' are 'prompt', required properties at '/' are 'messages' - Cause: AiError: 5006: Error: oneOf at '/' not met, 0 matches: required properties at '/' are 'prompt', required properties at '/' are 'messages' This seems like a similar error (…link…). Can you search Google for more of the same issue?
